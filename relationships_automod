        Your recent {{kind}} : " {{title}} " has been removed because our AutoModerator has found that your post may be dealing with rape or sexual abuse in some way. If you are seeking direct advice on dealing with such a situation (or are asking if something constitutes rape), we ask that you please post instead to /r/rape, /r/rapecounseling, or /r/secondary_survivors (if someone you know has been abused). These communities have dedicated userbases that can provide and better guarfpackantee the sort of sensitivity, support, and protection that may not be available here in /r/relationships. Please understand that you have done nothing wrong in posting here in the first place. We hope you understand that we are trying to make sure you get the best possible help available and give you the benefit of our experience in moderating this subreddit.  If you believe you are receiving this message in error, please message the moderators for reapproval.

        0. Send a request for reapproval by using the "Click to request approval" in the comment by AutoModerator below the {{kind}}.

        Please note that while temporary removal is automated, reapproval is done by a volunteer mod - and this may take a little time depending on the volume of requests and time-zone. **Please be patient, and send only one request for approval.**  

        This is an automated message. **DO NOT REPLY**

        [Click here (once) to request reapproval](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Frelationships&subject=Please+approve+my+{{kind}}&message=I+would+like+to+request+the+approval+of+my+{{kind}}+at:+%0A%0A+{{permalink}}+%0A%0A+---+%0A%0A+My+{{kind}}+was+pulled+for+*Being a post dealing with rape or sexual assault*.+%0A%0A+%0A%0A+/u/{{author}}#btn) and then click send **once** only.

        The reapproval is manual, so send a **single request** only. Multiple requests do not mean faster approval, in fact they may clog the modqueue and result in reapprovals taking even more time.

Once you submit an update, your previous post will be locked, to prevent further discussion on the original post.   
          Updates are not allowed on removed posts. Please read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/wiki/index#wiki_why_was_my_post_locked_and.2For_removed.3F) to see why your post may have been removed.

        All submission rules are listed in the sidebar and the [/r/relationships/wiki](/r/relationships/wiki/index#wiki_about_.2Fr.2Frelationships) (esp if you are on mobile).  
        Generally, you should take care of following when submitting a post :

        * Include the ages and genders of those involved, and the length of relationship.  
        * Avoid a wall of text, and should be broken into paragraphs. You need to add two returns between paragraphs for reddit to show them.   
            Refer to FAQ: [How to avoid "Wall of text"?](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/wiki/index#wiki_how_to_avoid_.22wall_of_text.22.3F) for some pointers.  
        * Include a tl;dr or any sort of short summary. Please edit your post to add a (preferably **bolded**) tl;dr.  
            Refer to FAQ: [What is TL;DR? Why do I need it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_tl.3Bdr.3F_why_do_i_need_it.3F) for some pointers.  
        * Avoid external urls.
        * Additionally, **please add flair to your post once you submit** by clicking 'flair' below the post and selecting the most appropriate topic-category.
            Refer to [Assign Flairs tutorial](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/wiki/assignflair) to know how to add a flair, or a tag to your submitted post.
            If you are using a mobile app that does not support adding flairs, you can mention so in your approval request to the mods.

        ---

        Once the {{kind}} is edited to comply with **all of the above rules**, it can be approved by moderators.

        0. Visit  
            {{permalink}}   
            and click the "edit" link below the {{kind}} to make proper edits
        0. Send a request for reapproval by using the "Click to request approval" in the comment by AutoModerator below the {{kind}}.

        Please note that while temporary removal is automated, reapproval is done by a volunteer mod - and this may take a little time depending on the volume of requests and time-zone. **Please be patient, and send only one request for approval.**  

        This is an automated message. **DO NOT REPLY**

        The above {{kind}} has been **temporarily removed** for **one or more** of the following reasons from the rules (as seen in sidebar):

        * It is an update post.   Our subreddit only allows a single update to provide the community closure on the situation presented in your original post.  If you believe you will have more information to share with the community after a few more days or weeks, we advise you to hold off on updating the community until you can summarize everything into a single update as you will no longer be allowed to make additional updates.  Once you submit an update, your previous post will be locked, to prevent further discussion on the original post.   
          Updates are not allowed on removed posts. Please read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/wiki/index#wiki_why_was_my_post_locked_and.2For_removed.3F) to see why your post may have been removed.

        You must make suitable edits to ensure that the {{kind}} confirms to **all the rules** listed in the sidebar, and in [wiki](/r/relationships/wiki/index#wiki_about_.2Fr.2Frelationships) (relevant for mobile users).  

        [Click here (once) to request reapproval](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Frelationships&subject=Please+approve+my+{{kind}}&message=I+would+like+to+request+the+approval+of+my+{{kind}}+at:+%0A%0A+{{permalink}}+%0A%0A+---+%0A%0A+My+{{kind}}+was+pulled+for+*being+an+update+post+without+links+to+original+post*.+%0A%0A+I've+read+the+sidebar+and+made+all+suitable+corrections+to+comply+with+the+rules.+%0A%0A+/u/{{author}}#btn) and then click send **once** only.    

        The reapproval is manual, so send a **single request** only. Multiple requests do not mean faster approval, in fact they may clog the modqueue and result in reapprovals taking even more time.
